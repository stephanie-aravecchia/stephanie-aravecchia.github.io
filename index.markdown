# About me

I am an Assistant Professor at [Georgia Tech Europe](https://europe.gatech.edu/), the European campus of Georgia Tech.
As a robotics researcher, I am interested perception and mapping from autonomous robots, with an emphasis on real-world applications. My research is conducted within the [DREAM lab](https://dream.georgiatech-metz.fr) of the joint Georgia Tech - CNRS International Research Lab.
Along with my research, I am teaching undergrad Computer Science courses. The students participate in a study abroad program from Georgia Tech, and spend a semester in the European Campus, Georgia Tech Europe.

I earned my Master’s degree from Arts et Métiers ParisTech in 2007. After a 9-year career in the industry, where I managed large teams and projects, I decided to shift my focus to robotics research, a field I had always been curious about. From 2017 to 2020, I worked as a robotics research engineer, before beginning my PhD, which I defended in 2023. My research, conducted under the supervision of Cédric Pradalier (Georgia Tech Europe) and Marianne Clausel (Lorraine University) focused on integrating map quality criteria into autonomous exploration in natural environments.
